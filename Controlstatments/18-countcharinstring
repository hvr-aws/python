# This code counts the occurrences of each character in a string and prints the count of each character, 
# the total number of unique characters, and the total number of characters in the string.  
# It uses a dictionary to store the character counts and iterates through the string to populate the dictionary.
# The final output includes the count of each character, the total number of unique characters, and the total number of characters in the string.
